# Introduction
## Project's seed
**Mapland** has been thought up by Anthony (whose alias is [JScriber](https://github.com/JScriber)), and a friend of his.
At the beginning, the project aimed to share all the heuristic cards created for the exams we both passed. Nowadays the goal hasn't changed, however the co-foundator has dropped the project, so his cards will sadly not be shared. 

## Useful and reusable cards
As said before, the project's main goal is to give out and share the work already done. Basically it is summarized courses which can still be useful to some people out there. So that is why this platform exists.
Our motto then is : 
> Instant Review Work!

# On the code's side
At first, the code was made so that anyone could add, or well, modify the standard structure and implement cards by touching the source code. So XML was used to build the website.
Since then, the project switched from XML to MySQL in order to make the code more readable and the platform more mutable without accessing the source code.

# Aesthetic & Design

## Responsive
The website is made so that even mobile devices can access the cards !

# Other things to mention
The shared heuristic cards are all written in French.
