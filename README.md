# Introduction
Mapland is a project which has been thought up by Anthony (whose alias is JScriber), and a friend of his.
At the beginning the aim of the project was to share all the heuristic cards created for the exams we both passed. However, the objectives have changed as the co-foundator dropped the project. 

## Useful and reusable cards
As said before, the project's main goal is to give out and share the work done beforehand.

The shared heuristic cards are all written in French.
